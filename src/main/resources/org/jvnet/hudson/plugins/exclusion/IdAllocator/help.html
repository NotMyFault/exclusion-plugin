    The purpose of this plugin is to manage conflicts between jobs. 
    
  <p>
    In order to manage resource conflicts, you can assign resource names to every job on Jenkins.
    This feature will be in charge of not building jobs that have same resources at the same time.

  <p>
    To use this feature, you have to activate the plugin and add the names of resources on each job that need them.
    For example, if you add a resource : "project1Database" on two jobs, it means that they can't be
    built at the same time. This is achieved without having to manually manage builds.
  <p>
    You can add as many resources as you need.
    
  <p>
     The next step to configure Exclusion plugin is to add two building steps. 
     The first one named "Critical block start" delimits the beginning of the exclusion zone.
     The second one named "Critical block end" which releases resources previously allocated.
