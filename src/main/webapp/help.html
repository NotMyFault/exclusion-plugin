    The purpose of this plugin is to manage conflicts between jobs. 
    
  <p>
    In order to manage datas conflict, you can assign resources name to every job on Jenkins.
    This feature will be in charge to not build jobs that have same resource at the same time.

  <p>
    To use this feature, activate the plugin and add resource(s) name on each job that needi it.
    For example, if you add a resource name : "project1Database"     on two jobs they can't be
    build at the same time. And this without you care to manage manually constructs.
    
  <p>
    You can add as many resources that you need.

     The next step to configure Exclusion plugin is to add two building steps. 
     The first one named "Critical block start" that delimite the beginning of the exclusion zone.
     The second one named "Critibal block end" that release resources.
